                        <strong>(Synopsis --> Around 100 billions year ago there was a civilisation called R Native lived on a
                        planet called RMX-20.)</strong> <br><br>

                        RMX-20 was a very resourcefull and growing planet than RMX-50 although it was far from having
                        the installation license of the ultimate resource CrZ-85. The availability of the CrZ-85 was a
                        plus point of the RMX-20. The representative of the planet RMX-20 was Aerygen. Aerygen was
                        governing the whole kingdom for more than thousands year.
                        You will be guessing how it even work. It's simple there was no sign of terror of death. They
                        lived their life for as long as they wish, until they want themselves to take rest from the
                        nasty works. As time passes the population of RMX-20 was decreasing. And they needed more
                        persons to maintain their status, as if they couldn't that will be the invitation to the native
                        settlers of RMX-50 to capture the best resource CrZ-85 of the universe.
                        King Aerygen ordered the lead scientist "Yodi" who led the foundation of the best inventions of
                        their planet to make some robots who could do their works, without being tired of it. He was a
                        very skilled and higly educated scientist. Altough he had made many inventions like the cosmic
                        Space-ships, Time lapse controller, very dangerous cosmic bombs and the most beautiful thing for
                        the planet was the way to extract the right amount of energy from the CrZ-85. This method was
                        prooven useful along with tiime beacuse the engines now can achieve a speed of 1000
                        lighyears/sec. This caused revolution, now it was very easy for people to afford space-travel. <br><br>
                        
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But due to shortage of labours the economy of planet was going down. Now he was on the project
                        to create some advanced robots who can do their work for like 33hrs regularly. (as 1 day on that
                        planet is equal to 33 hours).
                        So he began his experiments, he came up with idea that if he could use the CrZ-85 in these
                        robots, then this will be colossal achievement for the R-native.
                        He proposed that he will be using the CrZ-85's ultimate form after the minimal reaction in which
                        products formed are slighlty reactive. Then these slightly reactive materials will be used in a
                        reactor implanted inside these robots to power 'em up. After a year and half he made a prototype
                        robot called Zyulen. Zyulen was able to think using 70% of brain. Yodi was very proud of
                        himself. He presented the prototype to the Aerygen. He was ecstatic when saw the Zyulen. So he
                        asked Yodi for manufacturing more of 'em. As the Zyulen was the prototype only , so he was not
                        that much able to complete the task. After six months he created a reactor which is more
                        stablised and generate more power. Now the descendants of Zyulen were more powerfull and
                        energetic throught out the day. He named them as Adamyulen (Male) and Evaulen (Female) and
                        collectively as HUMOBOTS and this time he added a very advaced robotic system called
                        Reporsystem,. Reprosystem was able to produce new ones of there own by themselves. Now it was
                        time to test the both robots, and hence both were very good at their work.The Aerygen was very
                        fascinated by his work but he was amazed how the things can work like for a week without rest.
                        Yodi answered him ,"You know Matter is the main source of power in these robots, They are in the
                        core of these robots". Aerygen asked "But this could lead to disaster if it came in contact to
                        our environment" . Yodi replied,"These matters are contained inside the a thin container of
                        antimatter and these antimatter is held in middle with the help of electromagnetic wave, so that
                        if the matter came in contact to the antimatter container it will be destroyed only and the
                        antimatter of our surrounding will be safe.". Aerygen was impresed and awarded him with the
                        highest award. <br> <br>
                        
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After a hundred years the HUMOBOTS had increased a lot in population. Yodi
                        figured out that this increasing population is going to affect RMX-20 very badly. Adamyulen
                        thought that their communities are suffering as they are build to be ruled by someone. He formed
                        a secret organistaion called "Liberation - Yulen"
                        whose motive was to take over the planet RMX-20. As time passes the number of members of Yulen
                        increased at high rate. At the moment they decided to attack the Aerygen governing seat, Aerygen
                        came across this news. He ordered to disable all the robots. Yodi rushed toward the lab to take
                        the controller , but it was not there. Next moment he realised that Zuylen was not there. The
                        attack was clear. When Aerygen got this news he started a war. Yodi realised that if you loose
                        this will be dangerous for the other planet. So he made a plant to blow all the HUMOBOTS . He
                        made a plan to consolidate all of them at a speific place . Aerygen announced that the kingdom
                        capital is shifting from the Balyunerus to Galligen. This frightened the HUMOBOTS as this will
                        be hard to shift there whole community there and start the war. So they decided that they will
                        attack them today only. Yodi plan had worked out . His target was the Balyunerus only. The
                        fighter jet took off and was flying in mid air , and then they notice that there was a vast
                        number of crowd gathered in Balyunerus. The order was clear to blew them off at sight only. The
                        pilot was ordered to drop the bomb. As he pulled the trigger down the bombs went approaching the
                        grouund so fast.
                        The place blew in just seconds causing uncountable corpses. Suddenly there was a sign that
                        another bomb has exploded down the Balyunerus. After some moment Yodi figured out this was the
                        Cosmic bomb which was that enough tp destroy a planet. Yodi made this to threaten the people of
                        RMX-50,so that they wouldn't invade the RMX-20 and steal the CrZ-85. It became clear that the
                        RMX-20 was going to destory. The king Aerygen along with Yodi and their members took off from
                        the planet. After a minute the whole planet was surrounded by fire and suddenly a black hole
                        appears with a worm hole. Yodi was amazed to see this and later came to the solution that the
                        anitmatter propulsion lead the cosmic blast to form the worm hole for a second and the black
                        hole. But worm hole is too stabalised beacuse of the negative mass fromed due to the burning of
                        antimatter. Which lead the worm hole to grew bigger in size. The worm hole cause a time lapse
                        and multi diversion in time branching which made the planet and the space ship to travel in
                        future where time ends.
                        Yodi found that they were in the future of time but in the different universe. He was shocked
                        when he saw HUMOBOTS.
